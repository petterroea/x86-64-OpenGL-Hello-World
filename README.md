# Hello World OpenGL application in x86-64 assembly

I'm publishing this on github as there doesn't seem to be many good examples of OpenGL x86-64 programming on the internet. After all, why would you write OpenGL applications in x86-64? 

## Requirements

 * `cc`
 * `GNU make`
 * `glut`

I made this for linux, so your mileage may vary with anything else. It's probably not a huge issue, but the assembly isn't NASM compatible, from what i know.
